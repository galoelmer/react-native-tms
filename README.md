Welcome to the README for our Expo-powered React Native app! This document provides essential information and instructions for getting started with our app, including links to the web version and an online Android emulator for testing.

## Web App Version

You can access the web version of our app by following this link: [Web App Link](https://64ffdc31cef1e110d614582e--regal-boba-3e4bb3.netlify.app/).

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the app locally or on your own device, you need to have the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): You will need Node.js to run JavaScript code.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): These package managers are used to install project dependencies.
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/): You'll need the Expo CLI to set up and manage Expo projects.
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client): Install Expo Go on your Android or iOS device to test the app on your mobile device.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the app using Expo:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd [project-directory]
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the Expo development server:

   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

5. A new window or tab will open in your default web browser with the Expo DevTools. From there, you can choose to run the app on an Android or iOS simulator, or scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device to run the app on your smartphone.
